--- Setup ---

Step 1) create './config.php' with the following:

<?php 
  define('REGLOGDIR',dirname($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']).'/regs/');  
  define('TMPDIR',dirname($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']).'/tmp/');
  $mailto='robin@linuxaudio.org, marcg@dinkum.nl';
  $mailto=''; # if empty no email will be sent.
  # BASIC AUTH:
  $adminpass='YourPlainTextPassword';
  # HTTP AUTH: copy .htaccess-dist to .htaccess and edit it.
  $adminpass='';


Step 2+)
  mkdir regs/  # or whatever you spefied as REGLOGDIR
               # this directory will be used to store registration information

  chmod 1777 regs  # or `sudo chown www-data tmp/`
  echo "Deny from all" > regs/.htaccess
                   # ensure that your webserver honors .htaccess AllowOverrides
                   # by visiting the URL

  mkdir tmp/
  chmod 1777 tmp/  # or `sudo chown www-data tmp/`
                   # tmp folder is used to create PDF for the badges
                   # you need to have 'pdflatex' installed 
                   #
                   # it's also used to store aggregated information
                   # eg. pages/concerts.php
  echo "Deny from all" > tmp/.htaccess

Step 3+)
  create sqlite database in tmp/lac2011.db and make it writable for
  the HTTP-user..
    sqlite3 tmp/lac2011.db < schema.sql
    sudo chown www-data.www-data tmp/lac2011.db

--- Notes ---

The 'admin' interface is very rudimentary and can be reached at
  http://base-url/index.php?page=admin&secret=yourpassword
or with HTTP auth just:
  http://base-url/index.php?page=admin

to add/edit 'tabs':
  create the corresponding page in  pages/
  edit the $pages array near to the top in index.php.
  the current style.css allows for up to 9 tabs.
