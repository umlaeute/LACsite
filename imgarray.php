'04_WaitingtoEnterThePizzaHouse.jpg' =>
'Entrance to the italian restaurant was slightly delayed in order to give the waiters time to set the table. Looking up in the air is Lennart Poettering, main author of PulseAudio. To his left is Stefan Kost, of GStreamer fame. The other photographer up there is Fernando Lopez-Lezcano.',

'05_PreConferenceDinner.jpg' =>
'As said, national colors are orange, and some of us dressed accordingly to not be easily recognized as tourists. Left is Marc, then Fernando and Albert Gräf.

'Artistic shot of the "online character" of the whole conference.',

'31_FutureOfLACRoundtable2.jpg' =>
'Another shot of the "Future of LAC" roundtable. The location for next year\'s LAC was NOT determined here, though - there were several "possible candidates", but no definitive proposals. Do YOU want to host the next LAC? Then contact us at lac@linuxaudio.org :-).',

'33_SoundNight2_MalteSteiner.jpg' =>
'Again Malte Steiner. The SJU, where the sound night took place, offered 2 stages so that while one was used for a performance, the other could be set up for the next artist. That kept the audience in motion all the time :-).',

'34_SoundNight3_OlympicGames.jpg' =>
'The "Sound Night Olympic Games" is a live-coding experience where a referee (Marije Baalman) is collecting SuperCollider coding snippets from the contestants and can either pass these on to the "live" audio system, modify them or reject them...I hope this explanation is somewhat correct.',

'47_SoundNight16_FrankBarknechtOnIPhone.jpg' =>
'The Sound Night slowly comes to an end, and Frank Barknecht decides to do a little somewhat-improvised performance with his iPhone running PD. He has to hold it up since taking it down will cause the application to stop (intentionally).',

'52_AvoidingTheEvilLogo.jpg' =>
'Towards the end of the conference, Tarik Barri, a former student of Marc Groenewegen, is demonstrating his software "Versum". Since some people at the conference started disliking those laptops everywhere that show the "evil sign", this one was "disguised" a bit.',

'53_TarikBarri.jpg' =>
'Tarik Barri (http://tarikbarri.nl) during his demonstration. Check out the demo videos at his homepage - they\'re awesome! Being asked about open-sourcing that software, he felt like he first wants to earn some money with what he created, so we settled with the statement "once you have earned your first miilion with it, we\'ll get back to you about that open-source thingy".',

'54_VersumDemoAudience.jpg' =>
'The audience during the Versum demo. It was nice to see that even after 4 days of conference program, so many folks had still stayed at the HKU.',

'55_TarikDemonstratingVersum.jpg' =>
'A vague shot of what Tarik\'s "Versum" application looks like, from the controller\'s point of view. He is navigating through 3D with a space mouse (I think it was a "SpaceNavigator" from 3DConnexion).',

'56_FaridaAyojil.jpg' =>
'Time to thank everyone who helped for their involvements. This is Farida Ayojil from HKU, who took care of everything around the registration desk, paper work and who knows what else.',

'57_PostConferenceDinner.jpg' =>
'The obligatory post-conference dinner. Albert Gräf suggested to pick something a little more sophisticated than a Burgerking, so we went to the Indonesian "Selamat Makan". Yes, this is a very dark picture, sorry for that.',

'58_AndThePriceYouPayForIt.jpg' =>
'And the food was good and plenty, and the wine was fine...and the price was "slightly surprising" for some of us. Paying 1044 Euros for 21 people is somewhat more than most had expected, but the food was really good and as such a nice ending for the conference. Quoting Malte Steiner: "The same happened last year in Parma. You are really expensive friends_". :-)'
