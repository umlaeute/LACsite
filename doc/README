-----  LAC 2011/2012 website ----

--- Setup ---
Step 0)
  go to top-level directory of website this website 

Step 1) create 'config.php' with the following:

---------8<---------
<?php 
  define('REGLOGDIR',dirname($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']).'/regs/');  
  define('TMPDIR',dirname($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']).'/tmp/');
  define('LACY','2012');  

  $userewrite=false; # set to true if RewriteEngine is enabled in .htaccess
  define('BASEURL',''); # '/2012/' - same as RewriteBase incl. trailing '/'

  $regmail=true; # if set users will receive a confirmation email
	$regclosed=false;
  $hidepapers=false; # don't include links to papers (yet)
  $mailto='robin@linuxaudio.org, marcg@dinkum.nl'; # admin email
  $mailto=''; # if empty no email will be sent to admins.
---------8<---------

Step 2+)
  mkdir regs/      # or whatever you spefied as REGLOGDIR
                   # this dir will be used to store registration information

  chmod 1777 regs  # or `sudo chown www-data regs`
  echo "Deny from all" > regs/.htaccess
                   # ensure that your webserver honors .htaccess AllowOverrides
                   # by visiting the URL

  mkdir tmp/
  chmod 1777 tmp/  # or `sudo chown www-data tmp`
                   # tmp folder is used to create PDF for the badges
                   # you need to have 'pdflatex' installed 
                   #
                   # it's also used to store aggregated information
                   # eg. pages/concerts.php
  echo "Deny from all" > tmp/.htaccess

  #prepare upload folder.
  chmod 1777 download/  # or `sudo chown www-data download`

Step 3) OPTIONAL
  set up HTTP AUTH and apcahe URL rewriting
	copy .htaccess-dist to .htaccess and edit it. edit apache config
	to permit .htaccess Rewrite and allow auth overrides
  use `htdigest [-c] <file> <realm> <username>` to create the password file.

Step 4+)
  create sqlite database in tmp/lac2012.db and make it writable for
  the HTTP-user..

    sqlite3 tmp/lac2012.db < doc/schema_pdb.sql
    sudo chown www-data.www-data tmp/lac2012.db

  create sqlite database in tmp/reg2012.db and make it writable for
  the HTTP-user..

    sqlite3 tmp/reg2012.db < doc/schema_reg.sql
    sudo chown www-data.www-data tmp/reg2012.db

--- Notes ---

The 'admin' interface is very rudimentary and can be reached at
  http://base-url/index.php?page=admin
after setting up HTTP auth. 

Note: It won't work with Safari Browser (which use HTDigest auth
      not to for a whole namespace but only per file). Use Firefox or Chrome
      to access the admin interface

to add/edit 'tabs':
  create the corresponding page in pages/
  edit the $pages array in site.php
