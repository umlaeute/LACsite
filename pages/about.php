<h1>Good News</h1>
<p>
The submission for papers, music, installations, workshops, etc. has been closed
at the end of a long February 17th 2013.
The review committees are now busy working, reviewing and sorting the
submissions, so we can notify all submitters of their acceptance by March 6th
2013.
</p>
<p>
We've had many paper submissions and many many music submissions.
Somehow I feel sorry, because there are so many submissions that we cannot possibly accept them all.
But of course this is also great, as it shows that the LAC2013 will definitely be an exciting thing...
</p>
<!--
<p>

Founded in 1965, IEM is currently considered Austria's leading research
institution in acoustics and audio engineering and has gained international
reputation during the last decade for its research on spatial audio processing,
psychoacoustic evaluation experiments, computer music, and the assistance in
opera productions with live electronics and spatial sound.
Moreover, most scholars in Austria who are interested in computer music, musical
acoustics, recording, live-electronics, spatial sound and psychoacoustics are
aware of courses offered by IEM in different academic curricula.
Clearly, coverage of all those aspects is inherently multidisciplinary, bringing together arts,
technology, and science.
<br/>
IEM has been embracing linux audio as a production and research environment since the
mid-1990s, and has contributed to <acronym title="Free/Libre and Open Source Software">FLOSS</acronym>/Linux projects,
amongst others by providing drivers for
<a href="http://www.rme-audio.de/old/english/linux/alsa.htm" rel="external">multichannel soundcards</a>
and hosting the
<a href="http://puredata.info/" rel="external">Pure Data community portal</a> and
<a href="http://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/" rel="external">Mailing lists</a>.
