<h3>Parking</h3>
<p>
The premises of the university are limited by gates with an intercom. 
There is a short-term parking zone surrounding the campus,
so we suggest to use public transport or walk the last mile.
(Note that you can stay in the short-term parking zone on Thursday (which is a
bank holiday in Austria) and during the weekend (Saturday afternoon/Sunday).)
