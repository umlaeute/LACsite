<h1>Staying in Palo Alto</h1>

<p>Unless you plan to have a car (and pay for parking at Stanford), you should definitely make sure you find a hotel that is close to the <a href="http://transportation.stanford.edu/marguerite" rel="external">Marguerite shuttle</a>, the free bus service Stanford provides. If you look at the <a href="http://transportation.stanford.edu/pdf/marguerite-schedule-map.pdf" rel="external">schedule (PDF)</a> you'll see not all lines run on weekends (check O and N for nightly services and SE for weekend services). You will most likely be taking the Marguerite everyday to get to campus (the Stanford Campus is BIG). Most Marguerite lines stop at the <a href="http://g.co/maps/nsgja" rel="external">Palo Alto Transit Center</a>, so look for hotels that are walking distance to it. There is another Marguerite line that stops at the <a href="http://g.co/maps/3mxjq" rel="external">California Avenue Caltrain station</a>, so hotels near California Avenue are also an option.</p>

<h1>Traveling to Stanford</h1>

<p>CCRMA is housed in the Knoll, 660 Lomita Dr. Stanford, CA  94305. Please use the following directions in conjunction with the Stanford <a href="http://campus-map.stanford.edu/" rel="external">campus map</a> or <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=660+lomita,+stanford+ca&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=45.197878,82.265625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;z=16&amp;layer=t" rel="external">Google Map</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>From the airports...</h3>

<p>You should fly into either San Francisco Airport (SFO) or San Jose Airport (SJC). From the airport, the best ways to get to Palo Alto are by train or by door-to-door shuttle. Details on each option:</p>

<p><strong>by Train</strong> (total cost around $10)</p>

<p><strong>From SFO</strong></p>

<p>take the BART (10 minute ride, $4 fee) to the Millbrae Station. Depending on the time of the day, you may have to get off at BART San Bruno and board another BART to Millbrae. From Millbrae station, take the Caltrain southbound (towards San Jose). Caltrain will be a 30 minute ride, and it costs $4.25. You will get off either at Palo Alto Caltrain Station, or California Avenue CalTrain Station, depending on where your hotel is. Caltrain website: http://www.caltrain.com/</p>

<p>If you want to go straight to Stanford, get off at Palo Alto Caltrain and take the free Marguerite Shuttle (line X or Y - see http://transportation/marguerite/), and ask to get off at the Tresidder Union stop. Walk away from the Union through the Tresidder parking lot and cross Mayfield Avenue. A pathway to the left of Florence Moore Hall leads up a hill. At the top of the hill is Lomita Drive, with the Knoll on your left.</p>

<p><strong>From SJC</strong></p>

<p>take the VTA Airport Flyer Route #10 towards the Santa Clara Caltrain station. This is a free bus. Note that there are two different Route #10 busses: one goes to the Caltrain Station (that's the one you want), the other goes to Metro Light Rail (don't take this one). The bus has a clear indication of which route it is, so it's easy. When you get off the bus at Santa Clara Caltrain station, take the Caltrain northbound (towards San Francisco). Caltrain will be a 20-30 minute ride, and it costs $4.25. You will get off either at Palo Alto Caltrain Station, or California Avenue CalTrain Station, depending on where your hotel is. Caltrain website: http://www.caltrain.com/</p>

<p>If you want to go straight to Stanford, get off at Palo Alto Caltrain and take the free Marguerite Shuttle (line X or Y - see http://transportation/marguerite/), and ask to get off at Tresidder Union stop. Walk away from the Union through the Tresidder parking lot and cross Mayfield Avenue. A pathway to the left of Florence Moore Hall leads up a hill. At the top of the hill is Lomita Drive, with the Knoll on your left.</p>

<p><strong>Door-to-door Shuttle</strong> (total cost around $30)</p>

<p>You can either make your reservation in advance, or you can just walk out of the airport and look for the designated space where SuperShuttle vans stop; you can get a van from there without a reservation. For more info, please check http://www.supershuttle.com/</p>

<h3>From San Francisco or San Jose</h3>
