<h1>Excursion</h1>

<p>
<em>Will you still be around Sunday afternoon?</em>
<br/>
The final event of the conference will be a trip to the beautiful south-eastern Styrian countryside,
renowned for its vineyards and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin_seed_oil" rel="external">pumpkin seed oil</a>...
</p>

<p>
More specifically we'll be heading to Pischelsdorf about two hours from Graz.
We'll start off with a musical excursion to the
<a href="http://algo.mur.at/projects/klangdom" rel="external">Klangdom</a>
- geodesic dome 3D soundsphere / powered by solar power and linux - and continue to
"<a href="http://www.buschenschank-bernhart.at/" rel="external">Buschenschank Bernhart"</a>
- an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuriger" rel="external">East-Austrian wine tavern</a> (aka Heuriger, aka Buschenschank).

<h2>Practical Information</h2>

<h3>When and how long?</h3>
<p>
We will leave at 11am from the Inffeldgasse 10 outside the main venue on the IEM campus with two busses.<br/>
The first bus returns early (after the Klangdom excursion) and arrives back in Graz at 14:30.
A second bus - for persons who want to join the <em>Buschenschank</em> - will be back around 18:00.
</p>

<h3>How much is the trip?</h3>
<p>
The bus trip is sponsored by LAC, but the drinks are on you :) Typical Austrian style "Buschenschank" in the countryside
is very reasonably priced, assume a total of about 10 &euro; for loads to eat and good wine to drink.
