<h1>Excursion</h1>

<p>
<em>Will you still be around Sunday afternoon?</em>
<br/>
The final event of the conference will be a trip to the beautiful south-eastern Styrian countryside,
renowned for its vineyards and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin_seed_oil" rel="external">pumpkin seed oil</a>...

More specifically we'll be heading to Pischelsdorf about two hours from Graz.
We'll start off with a musical excursion to the

- geodesic dome 3D soundsphere - and continue to
"<a href="http://www.posch-weine.at/cms/buschenschank.php" rel="external">Buschenschank Posch"</a> - a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuriger" rel="external">East-Austrian wine tavern</a> (aka Heuriger, aka Buschenschank).

<h2>Practical Information</h2>

<h3>When and how long?</h3>
<p>
We will leave in Graz after the last morning session and return back at around 16:00-18:00h.
If there are enough people who need to catch an outbound flight or train on Sunday evening, one of the buses could return early.
</p>

<h3>How much is the trip?</h3>
<p>
The bus trip is sponsored by LAC, but the drinks are on you :) Typical Austrian style "Buschenschank" in the countryside
is very reasonably priced, assume 10 &euro;.
